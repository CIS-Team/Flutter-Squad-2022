![This is an image](https://cambiodigital-ol.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flutter.jpeg)

### :white_check_mark: There is no specific road map to learn Flutter. but I will suggest some resource. :mag_right: 

# :pushpin: What is flutter?
- Flutter is a UI toolkit for creating fast, beautiful, natively compiled mobile applications with one programming language and a single codebase,
This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).
- It is an open-source development framework developed by Google and released in May 2017. Generally, Flutter is not a language; it is an SDK(Software Development Kit).
- Flutter apps use Dart programming language for creating an app.
- Flutter is mainly optimized for 2D mobile apps that can run on both Android and iOS platforms. We can also use it to build full-featured apps,
including camera, storage, geolocation, network, third-party SDKs, and more.


# :dart: What is Dart?
- Dart is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with C-style syntax. 
- It is open-source and developed by Google and released in 2011. 
- The purpose of Dart programming is to create a frontend user interfaces for the web and mobile apps.

## :rocket: let's start our journy to learn flutter, I will divide the roadmap into different levels..
<!--
### first if you are don't any thing about programing you will need to start from dart and need to solve some problems -->
- If you know any one programming language like C# , Java then you can grasp dart with within two to three days.
- else you will need to study dart well and need to solve some problems then you will Learn..
